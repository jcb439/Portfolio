                            <p>AirBend integrates three core methods to maximize user cooling by optimizing shape-changing cut geometries on a wearable. The design process combines geometry exploration to develop kirigami-inspired cut patterns, human form mapping to align openings with high-sweat zones, and material and technology testing to evaluate fabric behavior and sensor integration.</p>
                            
                            <p>Our optimization objective was to maximize the total opening area created by cuts while ensuring the wearable conforms to the user's 3D body geometry, following body contours without causing discomfort. Opening geometries were prioritized across body regions most prone to overheating, based on empirical body heat index data.</p>

Based on this data, a personalized temperature threshold is established for each user. Embedded sensors in the wearable actively track both body temperature and surrounding air temperature in real-time. When the sensors detect data exceeding the user's personal threshold, they send a push notification alerting the user to perform specific stretching motions. These bending movements passively activate the kirigami-patterned cuts in the wearable, opening ventilation channels that allow air to flow through and cool the body.</p>

Each pattern was scored based on these objective factors to determine which design would be most effective for passive body-cooling through natural movement. The winning pattern from this evaluation became the foundation for our subsequent sampling and filtering process.</p>

Constraints included surface area boundaries based on torso measurements and minimum cut spacing to maintain structural integrity.

From the first round, we established minimum threshold values necessary for effective actuation: T = 1.7 cm, H = 0.85 cm, W = 0.3 cm, L = 0.7 cm. We then tested larger values and observed fabric behavior under stretch. The optimal configuration was identified as: T = 1.2 cm, H = 0.95 cm, W = 0.4 cm, L = 1.2 cm, achieving up to 19.9% opening area when stretched. Values larger than these were found unsuitable for the project goals.</p>

                                    <p>The final 1:1 scale bodysuit pattern was laser-cut using CNC machines in the College of Human Ecology on a stretchy and lightweight polyblend material. The blue fabric (85% polyester/15% spandex) was selected because it provided the desired stretch, was not see-through, maintained structural integrity, and had better recovery after repeated stretching compared to the black alternative (80% polyester/20% spandex). We sewed the pieces together using a simple straight line stitch along the top and side seams, leaving the armholes and bottom open. This method maintained the fabric's stretch and flexibility while preserving the integrity of the kirigami cut design.</p>

                    <p>While our final prototype demonstrated promising optimization results, limited time for physical fabric prototyping leaves room for future improvements in design development and fabric testing to enhance user comfort and bending activation. Future work would involve testing our optimized cut pattern across a variety of stretchy and breathable fabrics using CNC fabric cutting to validate these findings. Designing for multiple body sizes would enable personalized optimization of bodysuit patterns to accommodate a broader range of users. Real-world wear testing across different climates would further validate our proof-of-concept for passive bending activation and maximized user cooling.</p>
