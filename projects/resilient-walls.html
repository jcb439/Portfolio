                        <p>In regions most vulnerable to climate change—particularly Small Island Developing States—the need for rapidly deployable, adaptable infrastructure is urgent. More than 60% of the population in Guyana, Tuvalu, and the Bahamas (approximately 10 million people) are exposed to 100-year flood hazards.</p>
                        
                        <p>Traditional solutions like gabion walls are heavy, material-intensive, and difficult to transport and assemble quickly.</p>

                    <img src="../images/projects/resilient-walls/millipede-gradient.png" alt="Millipede topology optimization gradient output">
                    <p>Using Grasshopper's Millipede plugin, we defined variable loading conditions, generated stress line maps, and identified three density zones for brick types. The gradient output revealed natural stress lines critical to our design.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 2: Grain Direction Strategy</h3>
                    <img src="../images/projects/resilient-walls/grain-direction-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing grain direction mapping">
                    <p>We aligned internal grain patterns with stress lines from topology optimization and alternated grain patterns in adjacent bricks to deflect crack forces. This created a natural assembly logic based on stress orientation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 3: Modular System Design</h3>

                    <p>We standardized brick dimensions at 1:20 scale with a uniform height of 15mm (30cm full-scale) and three lengths: 30mm, 45mm, and 65mm. Three density types were achieved through shell thickness variation.</p>

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>How do we control material density and grain direction simultaneously in 3D printed bricks?</p>

                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> We varied infill density (10%, 30%, 80%), but internal infill patterns created conflicting grain artifacts that overrode our intended grain direction.</p>

                            <img src="../images/projects/resilient-walls/successful-prints.png" alt="Successful prints with clear grain direction">
                            <p><strong>Success:</strong> We reduced infill to 0% and achieved differentiation through shell thickness only. Each brick was spatially oriented to align with intended grain direction.</p>
